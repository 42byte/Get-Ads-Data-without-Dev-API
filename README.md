# GetAdsDatawithoutDevAPI
Having no access to Ads DevAPI tokens these scripts make it possible to bypass this constraint and get the data programmatically. 

The AdsScript needs to be saved inside Ads. From there it has to be initiliazed. When finished, the ads_to_csv.py can be executed. It will get the data from the spreadsheet and transform the data to a pandas dataframe. From there the data can be processed further.
